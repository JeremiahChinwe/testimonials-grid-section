                            been looking to make a

                            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                            the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                            startup.</q></p>

                    <p class="text-[#48556ab3]"><q>Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
                            needed some structure from
                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
                            a
                            former
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                            and
                            staff
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                            agile team
                            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                            no
                            tutorial
                            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple
                            offers.
                            100% recommend!</q></p>
